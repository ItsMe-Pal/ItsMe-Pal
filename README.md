# Hi üëã, It's Me, Pal

## About This Repository

**"We"** ‚Äì that's how I prefer to describe this project, as a tribute to all the future contributors and developers who will invest their time in building 100% free and open-source projects. The mission here is simple yet profound: **to make the world a better and more collaborative place.**

As for "It's me, Pal," I hope this phrase will be remembered as a testament to any helpful work that emerges from this endeavor, even after I'm gone.
